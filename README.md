# voiceTracker

A simple implementation of a synth voice-assignment tracker, intended for use in simple MIDI-driven synthesizers which need to keep track of a fixed number of voices in, e.g. a polyphonic synthesizer context.

- functions_named_like_this are utility/test/stub functions.
- functionsNamedLikeThis are implementation functions.

'make test' to see two test cases, first with fixed note assignments and then with random assignments.  Run voice_tracker manually to have a non-sorted test output.
